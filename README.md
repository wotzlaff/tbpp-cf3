# Compact Models for the Temporal Bin Packing Problem with Fire-Ups

This repository contains compact models for the Temporal Bin Packing Problem with Fire-Ups.
The problem was introduced in [[1]](#1).
Some improvements for the basic models were proposed in [[2]](#2) and [[3]](#3) (cf. the repository [tbpp-cf2](https://github.com/wotzlaff/tbpp-cf2)).
A preliminary version of a paper explaining the implemented models can be found in [[4]](#4).

## Examples
